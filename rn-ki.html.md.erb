## Version 1.0.9
**Release Date: July 1, 2016**

### Notes
* PCF Metrics 1.0.9 - now with stemcell 3232.12. Release also bumps required CLI to CLI v6.19.

### Known issues
See below.

## Version 1.0.8
**Release Date: June 23, 2016**

### Notes
* This release fixes a route issue in prior versions of PCF Metrics v1.0 where you could receive a "404 Not Found: Requested route does not exist in PCF Metrics" error.

### Known issues
* For applications that do not have any activity in the past 24 hours (which means no app events or http requests have been generated), users will not see any data in the UI. They will also need to refresh their browser after metrics are generated by the use of the app.
* While installing the PCF Metrics tile, the default Resource Config settings for each resource pool may be over-sized for POC/Beta purposes. You may adjust them manually to fit your environment. 
* No direct upgrade path. Operators can delete the installed tile and install the new tile.  This does result in downtime and data loss.

## Version 1.0.4

### Notes
* Update to use Stemcell 3146.11
* Change list of apps available to a user and prevent overload of Cloud Controller API
* The route for the PCF Metrics application is registered as `metrics.<system-domain>` in this v1.0.4 release.   The application can be accessed at `https://metrics.<system-domain>`
* The install will create a small deployment suitable for hundreds of apps. This is not configured for thousands of apps.

### Known Issues
* Route mappings for `metrics.<system_domain>` and `metrics.<system_domain>/v2` may be overwritten or incorrectly mapped during redeploys.
* For applications that do not have any activity in the past 24 hours (which means no app events or http requests have been generated), users will not see any data in the UI. They will also need to refresh their browser after metrics are generated by the use of the app.
* While installing the PCF Metrics tile, the default Resource Config settings for each resource pool may be over-sized for POC/Beta purposes. You may adjust them manually to fit your environment.
