The Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; (PCF) Metrics tile stores metrics data from applications running on PCF and graphically presents that data for operators and developers. PCF Metrics helps operators and developers better understand the health and performance of their apps by providing a near real-time view of the following data:

* Container metrics: CPU, memory, and disk percentages (updated every 30 seconds)
* Network metrics: requests per second, HTTP errors per second, and request latency (updated every second)
* App events: create, update, start, stop, and crash (updated as they happen)

## <a id='install'></a>Installing PCF Metrics

### <a id='pre-reqs'></a>Prerequisites

1. Ensure that you have installed the [Elastic Runtime Tile](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/installing/index.html).
1. Ensure that you have installed the [MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry Tile](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/index.html).
	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must install the MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry Tile even if you intend to use your own MySQL service for rule storage.</p>

### <a id='step1'></a> Step 1: Set up the Notification Service

1. From the **Installation Dashboard**, select the **Elastic Runtime** tile.
1. Click **Email Notifications**.
1. Enter an email to send notifications from, along with the SMTP Server configuration.
1. Click **Save**. 
1. Click **Errands**.
1. Select **Notifications** under **Post-Deploy Errands**.
1. Click **Save**. 
1. From the Installation Dashboard, click **Apply Changes** to install the notification service.

### <a id='step2'></a> Step 2: Add the PCF Metrics Tile to Ops Manager

1. Download the PCF Metrics file from
   [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pcf-metrics).
1. Upload the PCF Metrics file to your Ops Manager installation.
1. Click **Add** next to the uploaded product description in the **Available Products**
   view to add PCF Metrics to your **Installation Dashboard**.

### <a id='step3'></a>Step 3: Configure the PCF Metrics Tile

From the **Installation Dashboard**, click the **PCF Metrics** tile.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The tile appears orange when it requires configuration.</p>

#### Assign Availability Zones (AZs) and Networks.

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.
1. Select an Availability Zone under **Place singleton jobs**.
   <br>
   Ops Manager runs Metrics jobs with a single instance in this Availability Zone.
1. Select one or more Availability Zones under **Balance other jobs**.
   <br>
   Ops Manager balances instances of Metrics jobs with more than one instance
   across the Availability Zones that you specify.
1. Use the drop-down menu to select a network.
1. Click **Save**.

#### Ingestor Options

1. Click **Push Ingestor**.
1. Review the instance count. By default, the tile will deploy one instance of the ingestor. If you expect a high level of inbound log traffic, you may need to increase the instance count.
1. Click **Save**.

#### Alerting System Options
1. Click **Alerting System Options**
1. Select **Enable debug endpoint** if you want to access pprof information about the PCF Metrics tile. You can view this endpoint by navigating to `alerts-api.YOUR-DOMAIN/debug/pprof` and logging in with the **debug_credentials** under the **Credentias** tab of the PCF Metrics tile. 

#### Database Options

1. Click **Rules Database**.
1. You can configure PCF Metrics to use either Pivotal MySQL for Cloud Foundry or an external MySQL as its database source: 
	* (Option 1) To use Pivotal MySQL, select **MySQL tile** and enter a **Service Plan Name**. To see the available MySQL service plans, run `cf marketplace` from the cf CLI and note the plans listed under `p-mysql`.
	* (Option 2) To use an external database, select **External MySQL** and enter the **Database URL** in the format `mysql://username:password@hostname:port/db_schema`.
1. Review the **Max Idle Connection** and the **Max Open Connections** counts. You can use these fields to tune the connections to your database. 
1. Click **Save**.

#### Errands

1. Click **Errands**.

1. Review the **Pre-Delete Errands**. If you deselect the **Cleanup** checkbox, artifacts may remain after the PCF Metrics tile uninstalls.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The PCF Metrics tile selects all <strong>Post-Deploy Errands</strong>, by default. Do not deselect any of these checkboxes.</p>

#### Resource Config

1. Click **Resource Config**.
1. Review the resource configurations. By default, the settings match the instance types that are best suited for each job. If you expect a high level of use, you may need to increase the disk resources available to your instances.
1. Click **Save**.

#### Stemcell

1. Navigate to [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io) and click **Stemcells**.
1. Download the appropriate stemcell version for your IaaS.
   <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> On AWS make sure to use a HVM stemcell if you are using the default instance sizes.</p>
1. Click **Import Stemcell** and select the stemcell file you downloaded.

### <a id='step4'></a>Step 4: Deploy PCF Metrics

Click **Apply Changes** to install the service. Review the [Using PCF Metrics](using.html) topic for more information on how to log in, use, and interpret data from PCF Metrics.
